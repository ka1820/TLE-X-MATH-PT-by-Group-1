<Font face = "Verdana", size = "5", color = "Yellow">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.
<br>
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through 
<br>
droplets generated when an infected person coughs,sneezes, or exhales.
<br>
These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, 
<br>
and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.</font>
